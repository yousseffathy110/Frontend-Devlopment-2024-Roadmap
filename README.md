# Frontend Development 2024 Roadmap

## 🚀 Introduction to Front-End Development

Front-end development is all about creating the **look and feel** of a website or web app. It's what users see and interact with—buttons, fonts, colors, animations—everything from login forms to stunning homepages. It’s where **design meets code**! 🎨💻

Front-end developers are the creative force behind **user interfaces**, bringing designs to life using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. But in 2024, it’s more than just these basics. Today, you’ll need to know modern tools like **React**, **Vue**, **Tailwind**, and more to craft sleek, responsive applications. 💡✨

If you want to build **awesome user experiences** in 2024, stick around—I'll walk you through everything you need to start your journey in front-end development! 🙌

# 🛠️ Important Tools

There are some essential tools for any developer path, such as **Basic Terminal Usage (Command Line)**, **Git - Version Control**, and **GitHub**.

> **Note:** Learn these tools in parallel with the rest of your courses! 📚

## 🖥️ Basic Terminal Usage (Command Line)

The terminal is an interface used to execute text commands, giving access to the underlying operating system. Mastering basic terminal usage is a must for all developers, regardless of their specialization. It's an essential skill, so I strongly recommend learning how to use it effectively.

> **Tip:** If you're on Windows like me, I recommend using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### **📚 Here are some resources to learn the command line:**

## 🗂️ Git - Version Control

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their projects and collaborate with teams. It ensures that there are no code conflicts between contributors, making it a must-have tool in any development environment.

## 🌍 GitHub

GitHub is a code-hosting platform that allows teams to collaborate on software projects and use Git for version control. With GitHub, teams can create centralized repositories where each member can contribute, manage code, and maintain version history.
